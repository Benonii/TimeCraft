            <h2>How this app came to be</h2>
            <p>This app is a product of my obsession with tracking my time. I wanted to know exactly how much time I was working for and how much time I was knowingly and unhnowingly wasting on a daily basis.</p>
            <!-- <img src="images/paper-log.jpg" alt="Proof of my obsession"> -->
            <small>Image: Proof of my obesssion</small>
            <p>And so TimeCraft was born. It can handle multiple users, keep track of multiple tasks for a user. It can also give you daily, weekly and monthly reports.
